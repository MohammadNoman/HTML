        <h1>The Stoy in the Book</h1>
        <h2>Chapter 02</h2>
        <p>I had been starting out of my window for about an hour now. On my desk, lying between the copies of <i>Nature</i>, <i>New Scientist</i>, and all the other scientific journals my work had appeared in, was a well thumbed copy of <cite> On The Road</cite>. It had been my favorite book since college, and the longer i spent in these four walls the more i felt she needed to be free.</p>
        <p>I had spent the last ten Years in this room, sitting under a posterwith an Oscar Wilde qoute proclaiming that <q>Work is a refuge of people who have nothing better to do</q>>. Although many considered my poineering work, unraveling the secrets of the llama<abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr>, to be an outstanding achievement, I <em> did</em> think i had something better to do.</p>
